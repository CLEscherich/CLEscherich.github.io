This is a read me file for the Quiz generator 
I had some trouble with trying to get the scoring to pop up at the end of the quiz but this is the code I got so far

// var score = 0;
  for(var i=0; i < questions.length; i++) {
  var response = window.prompt(questions[i] {
    score++;
    alert("right");
    } else {
    alert ("wrong"); 
    }
  }
  alert("you got" + score + "/" + questions.length);
  
  
  I was able to find this bit online and tried tweak it for my code
  I wasn't sure if I need to put pictures of my code or not so I tried to put 
  the images in the readme but I couldn't get it to work so I made a folder with the images
  I will be working on this so I can do this on the next homework.
